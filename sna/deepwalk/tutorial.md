This is not a tutorial, in fact. As [deepwalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk) is quite easy to understand and implement, I would try to make a brief introduction:

Deepwalk is trying to learn vector representation of graph as the word2vec does, however its corpus are generated from random walk of graph, which a walk can be seen as a sentence.



### Things to know about deepwalk

1. deepwalk is about learning to represent vertex in a graph.

2. deepwalk has been proved that it has similar properties with matrix factorization[2], which have been discussed in our previous lectures.
