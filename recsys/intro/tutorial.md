## Introduction to Apache Giraph

Apache Giraph is an open-source *iterative* graph processing system for large-scale data. I would give some reading matrials for you, which might help you get deeper understand on this cool things.

### Objective

BTW, learning this tool is not the most important, the underlying programming model/paradigm is what we really need. Like MapReduce in Hadoop, here we have BSP in Giraph.

FYI, there're several graph processing systems. Such as GraphX in Apache Spark, ODPS-GRAPH of Alibaba and Pregel of Google. As I know, Giraph is now widely used at Facebook. 

So why I choose Giraph? It's build on top of Hadoop. Many startups choose Hadoop as their first generation of large-scale data system, for its better ecosystem. But it's okay for those prefer Spark, they are BSP, just different API.

In this 'course', you would learn a super cool weapon for processing large-scale graph data, and its programming model behind. With just two simple but useful examples. 

You would also know its industrial uses in real-world, and how people make innovation on this tool, to make it better.



### Key concepts you should know in this chapter.

 * What is the difference between BSP and MapReduce. a.k.a What's the advantages of Giraph, or how can I choose this as my hammer?

 * What is super-step?


#### What's the difference between BSP and MapReduce.

As you know, Giraph is an iterative *graph* processing system. 

What's the nature of graph data?


#### What's super-step?

As you've seen, Giraph is an *iterative* graph processing system.

Each iteration in Giraph, is call super-step.
