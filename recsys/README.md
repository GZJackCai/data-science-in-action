### Objective

I begin my study in recommendation system as I join p13n of data science team @Aliababa, then I choose to finish my undergrad thesis in this area.

In real-world data science, we not only consider how to use a model or algorithm with right data and tools, but also take care of issues of scalability. In general, Giraph is a cool and useful tools handling large amount of graph data under BSP.

Giraph is an open-source implementation of Google's Pregel system, and it has been widely used at Facebook.



The objective of this repo, is to follow the learning by doing, get familiar with this tool, and its programming model behind. I would also consider make my own contribution to this project in the near future.
