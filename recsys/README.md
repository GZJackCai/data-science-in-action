### Objective

I begin my study in recommendation system as I join p13n of data science team @Aliababa, then I choose to finish my undergrad thesis in this area.

In real-world data science, we not only consider how to use a model or algorithm with right data and tools, but also take care of issues of scalability. In general, Giraph is a cool and useful tools handling large amount of graph data under BSP.

Giraph is an open-source implementation of Google's Pregel system, and it has been widely used at Facebook.


The objective of this repo, is to follow the learning by doing, get familiar with this tool, and its programming model behind. I would also consider make my own contribution to this project in the near future.


### Topic has already covered

** Introduction of parallel graph processing system **

 > The code here are forked from [okapi](https://github.com/grafos-ml/okapi), Large-scale ML & graph analytics on Giraph. I just add some necessary comment in the code, and try to make it as a good reading matrials and tutorials for newbies.

We start from implement a simple PageRank algo with [Apache Giraph](http://giraph.apache.org) (an open-source version of Pregel at Google), which is an large-scale graph processing system. Its programming model is called BSP, 'think like a vertex'.

I would take PageRank as your first example, and show you how to 'think like a vertex'. Then we would introduce matrix factorization and its Giraph implementation.


### More features on the road

** Speeding up Apache Giraph in collaborative filtering. **

** Diversity, novelty and more **
